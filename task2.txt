Objects and its internal representation in Javascript
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. for example, A bottle is an object, with properties. A bottle has a colour, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
Objects in JavaScript:
1.	By object literal
2.	By creating instance of Object directly 
By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
 
Property and value is separated by colon(:).
Example:- var class{
		Student:”Raj”,
		Subject:”maths”,
		Marks:48,
		}
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
 
Here, new keyword is used to create object.
Example:
  		Var student=new object();
		 	Student.id=908021;
			Student.name=”Raj”;   
			Student.marks=50;
Accessing JavaScript Objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
objectName.property
or
objectName[“property”]
Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,
Class.student
Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],
Student[name]
